# Parkday-Data-Science-Technical-Take-Home

This is the README.md file for this project. I'll update this by the final submission to detail my process of taking on this task, what I learned, and what could be done or improved in the future.

For this project, the objective was described as such:
"Analyze a set of user and meal data and 1) characterize the data for insights, 2) implement meal recommendations, and 3) suggest next steps in a data science pipeline buildout"
